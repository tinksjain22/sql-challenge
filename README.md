# SQL Challenge
## Overview
This project involves working with employee data from the fictional company Pewlett Hackard. The objective is to design, implement, and analyze data using SQL based on CSV files from the 1980s and 1990s.

## Background

You will design the tables to hold the data, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. This involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Instructions
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

### Data Modeling
- Inspect the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables. 

### Data Engineering
- Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files with the Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
  
### Data Analysis
Answer the following queries:
1. List employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department, including their department number, name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List department number for each employee, along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with B.
6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. List employees in Sales and Development departments, including employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. List frequency counts of all employee last names, in descending order.
